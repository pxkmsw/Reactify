# Reactify
A React/GraphQL/Next.js boilerplate for Shopify

## Getting Started

For now, just clone this repo and refer to the [Endpoint API documentation](https://help.shopify.com/api/storefront-api). 

## Goals

### The Problem

Shopify has one of the most user-friendly ecommerce back-ends out there, as well as an amazing range of plugins and extensions. But when it comes to developer workflow, it doesn't quite measure up to the modern JavaScript ecosystem. 

Some of the issues include:

- Local theme development still requires a connection to preview your changes.
- Deploying to staging requires manually switching to a different theme.
- Using ES6/etc. requires running a build tool separately.
- No support for more advanced front-end tools like React, Redux, etc.
- No access to modern developer testing tools like [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org).

### The Solution

This boilerplate project gives you a ready-made front-end for your Shopify store that will connect to your store's GraphQL endpoint. You can then host your front-end separately from your Shopify back-end, while benefiting from all the awesome JavaScript tools and libraries you're used to. 

## Overview

### React

React has quickly established itself as a new standard for web and mobile development and its component-based approach is a perfect fit for complex ecommerce sites.

### GraphQL

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org) is a new data querying syntax that lets you ask your back-end for what you need in a very granular and precise fashion. 

### Apollo

[Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)

### Redux
